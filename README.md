## üîí Privacy Features

- **Private Contributions**: Choose between public or private contributions using zero-knowledge proofs
- **Threshold-Based Reveal**: Campaign details remain private until funding target is met
- **Secure Multi-Party Computation**: Leverages Partisia's MPC capabilities for threshold-based revelation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript application with modern UI components
- **Blockchain**: Partisia Blockchain testnet with MPC-20 token support
- **Privacy Layer**: Zero-knowledge proofs for private contributions
- **Wallet Integration**: Parti wallet and Metamask support
